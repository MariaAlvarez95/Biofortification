#Biofortification Dashboard

## Project Description

This dashboard explores the impact of biofortification programs aimed at addressing hidden hunger in regions like Africa, Asia, and Latin America. By analyzing data from the HarvestPlus program, it highlights the relationship between nutrient enrichment in crops and agricultural yield. The dashboard is designed for researchers, policymakers, and agricultural organizations to understand and scale biofortification efforts.

## Key Features

**1. Scatter Plot: Micronutrient Concentration vs. Yield**

* Visualizes the relationship between micronutrient concentration and crop yield.
* Allows identification of high-performing crops and successful breeding programs.
* Includes interactive tooltips with crop and variety details

**2. Interactive Filters and Summary Table**

* Enables filtering by continent and micronutrient.
* Summarizes key metrics like average yield and the number of releases by crop and country.
* Provides insights into top-performing regions and crops.

**3. Bar Chart: Average Yield by Continent and Type of Food**

* Compares yield performance across continents and food types.
* Highlights regional strengths and opportunities for targeted interventions.

**4. Dataset Information**

* Source: HarvestPlus Biofortification Program.
* Contains 450 entries, spanning multiple continents and crop types (2004â€“2024).

## Dataset Description

* Source: HarvestPlus
* Sample Size: 450 entries.
* Collection Method: Surveys and breeding program reports.
* Study Population: Smallholder farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

## Real-World Impact

Biofortification offers a scalable and sustainable solution to combat hidden hunger by enhancing the nutritional value of staple crops. This project demonstrates how such programs can improve both human nutrition and agricultural productivity.
